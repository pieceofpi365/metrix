# Linda 3.2.0.0

This is a minor release designed to improve performance and handle the increasing volume of transactions on the network.

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at github: https://github.com/thelindaproject/linda/issues

## How to Upgrade
If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then just copy over the appropriate Linda-Qt or Lindad file.

The first time you run after the upgrade a re-indexing process will be started that will take anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours, depending on the speed of your machine.

#### If you your wallet balance is incorrect run Linda with the rescan startup flag

## About this Release

### What's New
- Implemented Pieter Wuille's many optimizations to the way transactions are verified, so a running, synchronized node uses less working memory and does much less I/O. He also implemented parallel signature checking, so if you have a multi-CPU machine all CPUs will be used to verify transactions. 
- “Bloom filter” support in the network protocol for sending only relevant transactions to lightweight clients.
- Remove peercoins sync checkpoints.
- Payments (transaction outputs) of 0.546 times the minimum relay fee (0.00000546 LINDA) are now considered ‘non-standard’, because storing them costs the network more than they are worth and spending them will usually cost their owner more in transaction fees than they are worth.
- Network code performance and robustness improvements.
- Blk file performance and robustness improvements (blk files are now stored in blocks folder inside the data dir).
- Log timestamps by default.
- Added checkpoint at POW end block to ignore V2 forks.
- RPC Server "Warm-Up" Mode. The RPC server is started earlier now and will return immediate error with code -28 to all calls until all initialisations are done.
- Adjust block limits when selecting masternode to distribute rewards evenly, daily.
- Infrequently resend failed wallet transactions to avoid stuck transactions.
- Updated peer stalling to address the many orphans problem and help prevent stuck block downloads
- Added wallet encryption status to rpc method getinfo
- Added `listaddressbook` `addressbookadd` `addressbookremove` RPC commands to manage wallet sending addresses through the RPC
- Update to autotools build system
- Wallet will lock inputs set in masternode.conf to prevent accidental spending of masternode collateral.
- Add RPC `lockunspent`, to prevent spending of selected outputs and associated RPC `listlockunspent`.


#### New startup commands
- dbcache : controls LevelDB memory usage
- par : controls how many threads to use to validate transactions. Defaults to the number of CPUs on your machine, use -par=1 to limit to a single CPU
- reindex : rebuild block and transaction indices from the downloaded block data
- zapwallettxes: to rebuild the wallet’s transaction information

### Bug Fixes
- Fix nodes forwarding transactions with empty vins and getting banned.
- Fix a sync error due to a rounding discrepancy.
- listtransactions now returns masternode payment amounts.
