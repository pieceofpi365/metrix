# Linda 3.3.0.0

This is a new minor version release, bringing both new features and bug fixes.

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at github: https://github.com/thelindaproject/linda/issues

## How to Upgrade
Shut down Linda, wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then just copy over the appropriate Lindad file.

If you are upgrading from 3.1.0.1 or older, the first time you run after the upgrade a re-indexing process will be started that will take anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours, depending on the speed of your machine.

## Downgrading warnings
The 'chainstate' for this release is not always compatible with previous releases, so if you run 3.3 and then decide to switch back to a 3.2 release you might get a blockchain validation error when starting the old release (due to 'pruned outputs' being omitted from the index of unspent transaction outputs).

Running the old release with the -reindex option will rebuild the chainstate data structures and correct the problem.

Also, the first time you run a 3.2 release on a 3.3 wallet it will rescan the blockchain for missing spent coins, which will take a long time (tens of minutes on a typical machine).

## Linda-cli
We are moving away from the Lindad executable functioning both as a server and as a RPC client. The RPC client functionality ("tell the running Lindacoin daemon to do THIS") was split into a separate executable, 'Linda-cli'. The RPC client code will eventually be removed from Lindad, but will be kept for backwards compatibility for a release or two.

## RPC
`walletpassphrase` 
The behavior of the `walletpassphrase` RPC when the wallet is already unlocked has changed between 3.2 and 3.3.

The 3.2 behavior of `walletpassphrase` is to fail when the wallet is already unlocked:
```
> walletpassphrase 1000
walletunlocktime = now + 1000
> walletpassphrase 10
Error: Wallet is already unlocked (old unlock time stays)
```
The new behavior of `walletpassphrase` is to set a new unlock time overriding the old one:
```
> walletpassphrase 1000
walletunlocktime = now + 1000
> walletpassphrase 10
walletunlocktime = now + 10 (overriding the old unlock time)
```
## Transaction malleability-related fixes
This release contains a few fixes for transaction ID (TXID) malleability issues:

- `-nospendzeroconfchange` command-line option, to avoid spending zero-confirmation change
- `IsStandard()` transaction rules tightened to prevent relaying and mining of mutated transactions
- Additional information in listtransactions/gettransaction output to report wallet transactions that conflict with each other because they spend the same outputs.
- Bug fixes to the getbalance/listaccounts RPC commands, which would report incorrect balances for double-spent (or mutated) transactions.

## Transaction Fees
This release drops the default fee required to relay transactions across the network and for miners to consider the transaction in their blocks to 0.001Linda per kilobyte.

Note that getting a transaction relayed across the network does NOT guarantee that the transaction will be accepted by a miner; by default, miners fill their blocks with 50 kilobytes of high-priority transactions, and then with 700 kilobytes of the highest-fee-per-kilobyte transactions.

The minimum relay/mining fee-per-kilobyte may be changed with the minrelaytxfee option. Note that previous releases incorrectly used the mintxfee setting to determine which low-priority transactions should be considered for inclusion in blocks.

The wallet code still uses a default fee for low-priority transactions of 0.01Linda per kilobyte. During periods of heavy transaction volume, even this fee may not be enough to get transactions confirmed quickly; the mintxfee option may be used to override the default.
